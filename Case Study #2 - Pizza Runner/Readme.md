## Key learnings
- Using **to_char()** function to extract the day from the timestamp for grouping
- Learn about the **corr(x,y)** function to find the relationship between two variables
- Learn two functions to split a string and produce a column with all string parts, each in a separate row
  - **unnest(string_to_array(text, delimiter)**: First, the string_to_array(text, delimiter) function splits the string and converts it into a text array by the             specified delimiter. Then unnest() function produces a column of array elements as rows.
  - **regexp_split_to_table(text, delimiter)**: It directly splits the string into a column of split parts with a given delimiter.
- Learn about the **string_agg()** function to concatenate a list of strings which is separated by a delimiter
- Learn two functions to determine the location in the string where the substring is being matched:
  - **strpos(string, substring)**
  - **position(substring IN string)**
- Learn to join multiple **CTEs** and **temporary tables** 
- Learn to use **aggregate functions** with **CASE statements** and **subquery**
