###  3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
SELECT 
	runner_id,
	COUNT(*) AS successful_orders
FROM runner_orders
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
``` 
	
#### Result set:

	pizza_name,
	COUNT(*) AS pizzas_delivered 
FROM customer_orders
INNER JOIN pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
INNER JOIN runner_orders USING(order_id)

###  6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS max_num_pizza_order
FROM customer_orders
INNER JOIN runner_orders USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 1
``` 
	
#### Result set:

###  7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS atleast_one_change,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS no_change
FROM customer_orders
INNER JOIN runner_orders USING(order_id)
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
``` 

#### Result set:

###  8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS both_exclusions_extras
FROM customer_orders

WHERE distance IS NOT NULL AND exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL
``` 
	
#### Result set:

###  9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

```sql
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) AS hour_of_day,
	COUNT(*) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
``` 
	
#### Result set:
