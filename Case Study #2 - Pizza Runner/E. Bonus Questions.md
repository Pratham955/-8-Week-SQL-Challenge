# üçï Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## Solution - E. Bonus Questions

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

Supreme pizza has all toppings on it.

We'd have to insert data into pizza_names and pizza_recipes tables

***

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE new_pizza_recipes AS
( SELECT *
  FROM pizza_recipes
)
 
INSERT INTO new_pizza_recipes 
VALUES (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12');
``` 
#### Result set:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE new_pizza_names AS
( SELECT *
  FROM pizza_names
)

INSERT INTO new_pizza_names 
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');
```

SELECT * 
FROM new_pizza_names 
INNER JOIN new_pizza_recipes USING(pizza_id)
```
